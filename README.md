This vault is to share the code used in paper 'Image Transfer Applied in Electric Machine Optimization' presented in RTUCON2020

The main coding language used in this project is Python (deep learning solver) and Matlab (JMAG solver & optimization)

The software used for data generation is JMAG

The deep learning framework used is PyTorch and the main adapted model is [Pix2Pix](https://phillipi.github.io/pix2pix/) from Phillip Isola

Feel free to download, study, modify and share this project.
